6)Data Visualization :
ïƒ˜	Visualization of open, high, low ,close price trends:
â€¢	The chart represents Bitcoin price trends using Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) values over a time period.
â€¢	The x-axis represents dates and times.
â€¢	The y-axis represents Bitcoin price in USD.
â€¢	A legend in the top-right corner identifies the different lines.
â€¢	The Bitcoin price declines sharply around the middle of the graph, indicating a significant price drop.
â€¢	After the drop, the price appears to stabilize and start rising again.
â€¢	The High and Low prices closely follow each other, showing price fluctuations within the given period.
â€¢	The Open and Close prices are also close to each other, indicating that Bitcoin didnâ€™t have extreme volatility after the big drop.
â€¢	The sharp price decline could be due to market news, a crash, or liquidation events.
â€¢	The recovery after the drop might indicate buyers entering the market, pushing the price back up.
â€¢	This will help us identify long-term trends and volatility.

ïƒ˜	Bitcoin Price Trend Over Time:
â€¢	This graph represents the Bitcoin Price Trend Over Time using a line plot.
â€¢	X-axis: Date & Time
â€¢	Y-axis: Bitcoin price in USD
â€¢	Orange Line: Bitcoin's closing price over time
â€¢	 Sudden price drops & jumps â€“ Indicates sharp fluctuations, possibly due to market events or missing data points.
â€¢	 Flat segments â€“ Suggests periods with little to no change in price.
â€¢	Gaps in the line â€“ Could be caused by missing data, incorrect indexing, or market inactivity.

ïƒ˜	Bitcoin Daily Returns:
â€¢	This graph represents Bitcoin Daily Returns over time.
â€¢	X-axis: Date & Time
â€¢	Y-axis: Daily Return (percentage change in closing price)
â€¢	Blue Line: Daily percentage change in Bitcoin's price
â€¢	Fluctuations in returns â€“ Indicates Bitcoin's price volatility.
â€¢	Some large spikes â€“ Suggests sudden price movements, possibly due to market events.
â€¢	Negative returns â€“ Represent periods where Bitcoin's price decreased.

ïƒ˜	Moving Averages for Buy/Sell Signals
â€¢	The graph Represents Moving Averages for Buy/Sell Signals
â€¢	BTC Close Price - orange
â€¢	50-Day SMA - Blue
â€¢	200-Day SMA - Red
â€¢	Buy Signal ðŸ“ˆ when SMA_50 crosses above SMA_200
â€¢	Sell Signal ðŸ“‰ when SMA_50 crosses below SMA_200

ïƒ˜	Investment Strategy performance
â€¢	The graph Represents Investment Strategy performance
â€¢	Buy& Hold- Orange
â€¢	SMA Strategy -Blue
â€¢	If Strategy Return > Buy & Hold, our strategy is profitable.
â€¢	If not, we need to optimize buy/sell signals.
